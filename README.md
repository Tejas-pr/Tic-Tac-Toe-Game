## Description

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe Game built using React and Vite. The game allows two players to take turns and play Tic Tac Toe on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

This project was built as part of learning React through the official React documentation. It showcases fundamental concepts such as component-based architecture, state management using hooks, and event handling.
